- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Muhunden Jayakrishnan (Jay), a 4th year PhD student in the lab of Prof. Dr. Peter Becker at the Biomedical Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) of Munich, Germany.   
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a hybrid Wet lab / Dry lab biologist broadly interested epigenetics, gene regulation and genome topology. 
- ðŸŒ± My current expertise includes benchwork and analyses of genomics experiments(ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Micro-C). I also dabble with ML-approaches for Confocal Imaging data and I'm now actively testing published ML-tools to study NGS data.
